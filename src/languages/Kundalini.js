                <h3>Kundalini</h3>

                <p>Kundalini as called in the Eastern traditions, specially in Hinduism, is also known as The Fire Serpent. It’s a life force energy that rests dormant in all human beings at the base of the spine and which when awakened will change the person completely as it transforms the physical, emotional, energetic and intellectual bodies.</p>

                <div className="col-12 col-md-5 offset-md-3">
                  <p>This Giant once awaken, will make itself known through the power that the energy brings and the experience of the activation can be quite frightening as one feels the energy raising up in the body and piercing forcefully the chakras to promote emotional healing.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="col-12 col-md-5 offset-md-7">
                  <p>Why Kundalini awakens in certain people and not in others is still a mystery as it seems to choose the individual regardless their spiritual or religion orientation, race, gender or age. People all over the Globe from different backgrounds are “randomly” having spontaneous Kundalini awakenings even without knowing what that is; while others have been trying to awaken it for years without success.</p>

                    <h3>That being said, it is safe to believe that there is indeed an element of grace and intelligence which chooses the ones who will be experiencing this phenomenon.</h3>

                    <p className="col-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1 text-left">Kundalini energy goal is to disintegrate the Ego (lower self) awakening the person to higher levels of consciousness. It’s the evolution in mankind leading to a life connected to The Source, lived from different perspectives and without fear or suffering which are constantly experienced by an individual acting from their Egoic consciousness.</p>

                    <p className="col-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1 text-left">It rewires the nervous system and realigns the brain balancing left and right sides to work harmoniously. The individual having a Kundalini awakening will be able to access some hidden gifts such as intuition, mental clarity and creativity. As the person evolves in the process they will experience enhanced physical senses, consciousness expansion and awareness.</p>

                    <p className="col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 text-left">They will live a life guided from the heart instead of the mind and learn to love and care for all living beings. They will acquire a deep feeling of peace and wellbeing coming from within which is not dependent or related to outside situations.</p> 

                    <p className="col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 text-left">It is a life in alignment with their Higher Self and the Universe leading to a non dual experience where the individual performs no judgements or have pre concepts towards people, situations and events. Operating outside the Ego, the person is rooted in the present moment which allows them to be part of the flow of life without trying to control it. It leads to Freedom and unconditional love.</p>

                <p>With higher levels of consciousness and vibrating into positive energy its common to experience synchronicities which sometimes may look like real miracles. Manifesting things becomes easier and with spiritual maturity the person will be able to create the life he or she desires.</p> 

                <p>By acting from the heart, its not unusual one chooses to serve others helping them on their spiritual path or contribute to the World using their talents and acquired gifts.</p>

                  <p>Considering my own experience during the Kundalini Awakening, I aimed to find tools or techniques which would support the Ego transformation phase which I believe to be the most difficult one due to the Emotional burden related to memories and traumas which need to be transcended in order to the consciousness to expand.</p>

                  <p>After many months living in an emotional rollercoaster, I found the Time Paradigm technique which allows a person, in only one session, to get rid of all negative emotional baggage related to Anger, Hurt, Fear, Guilt and Sadness. In only few minutes, years of negativity are transcended, thus supporting the Kundalini energy to move freely through the system reducing anxiety and allowing one to feel lighter and at easy during the process.</p>

                  <p>The Dark Night of the Soul phase might even be skipped or if it's still there, as the negative emotions have been eliminated the process will happen in a much more peaceful way.</p>

                  <p>Whatever you are experiencing at this moment, it’s important to surrender and trust the process. This is a natural consciousness evolution and the energy works with intelligence.</p>

                  <p>You may decide to not talk to people you don’t really trust as they may not understand what you are going through and might become concerned believing you are experiencing mental problems. That is understandable given that modern society is reluctant to talk about Spiritual and energetic phenomena and choose to be in ignorance when the subject is related to what the eyes can not see.</p> 

                  <p>This can be a difficult process but ultimately it will lead you to your full potential, living a joyful, connected and fulfilled life.</p>
